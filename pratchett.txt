The trouble with having an open mind, of course, is that people will insist on coming along and trying to put things in it.
It's not worth doing something unless someone, somewhere, would much rather you weren't doing it.
In the beginning there was nothing, which exploded.
Coming back to where you started is not the same as never leaving.
